Summary of the Python Script:

1. **Imports**:
   - Libraries like `os`, `pandas`, `googleapiclient`, `re`, and `datetime` are imported for file handling, data manipulation, Google Drive interaction, regular expressions, and date formatting.

2. **Keywords**:
   - A list of keywords (`AMM`, `SRM`, `CMM`, etc.) is defined to search within the "text" column of an Excel file.

3. **Google Drive Authentication**:
   - The `authenticate_drive_api` function authenticates the script with Google Drive using an API key.

4. **File Retrieval**:
   - `get_file_id_from_folder` retrieves the ID of a file from a specified folder in Google Drive using the folder ID.
   - `download_file_from_drive` downloads the file with the retrieved ID from Google Drive to a specified path.

5. **Sanitize File Name**:
   - The function `get_sanitized_filename` sanitizes the filename by removing special characters and replacing spaces with underscores. It uses data from the "wp" column in the Excel file.

6. **Process Excel File**:
   - The function `process_excel` reads an Excel file into a pandas DataFrame.
   - It checks the "text" column for keywords, adding a "Note" column where matches return `0`.
   - The processed file is saved to a folder `processed_files/` with a timestamped, sanitized name.

7. **Main Execution**:
   - The `main` function orchestrates the process: reading an API key and folder ID from `link.txt`, authenticating the API, downloading the file, and then processing it.

The script interacts with Google Drive to fetch an Excel file, processes it by checking for specific keywords, and saves the result with a timestamped filename.
